## Cracking the gender code: recommendations

### Junior high (10-14 years)

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 1**: Deepen girls' hands-on computing experience
  + More exposure to games = more likely to go into coding (But ...)
  + Introduce coding through computer games

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 2**: Change girls' perceptions of computing
  - Challenge stereotypes
  - Role models

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 3**: Support parents in understanding the wider role of computing

:::

::: {.fragment}
> *"... there is little awareness among any group that applying computing and coding to real societal problems can help change the world, which can be a powerful hook for girls and a magnet for women."*
:::


##

### High school (14-18 years)

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 1**: Redesign computing courses to appeal to girls

> *"81% of high school girls who studied computing over the summer were interested in studying computing at college, compared to 52% of those who only studied computing at school."*

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 2**: Create grassroots campaigns to motivate peer group action

> *"Definitely [girls want] more clubs and after schools programs. We should be making a connection between ladies of distinction and computing or coding, because a lot of the girls want to feel empowered."* (Teacher)

:::

## 

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 3**: Attract more women teachers

> *"62% of girls in high school who have had someone encourage them to study computing and coding say they are likely to major in it at college, compared to only 15% who have had no role model."*

![](media/ms_confident.png){fig-align="center" width=500 }

:::

##

### College (18+ years)

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 1**: Give computing courses a makeover

> *"This includes engaging young women by describing computing courses – and
potential careers in the field – in ways that capture women's strong interest in
problem-solving, especially around real-world and social issues."*

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 2**: Offer female students immersion programs (allow exposure to coding on non-coding courses and make it easy to switch).

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 3**: Create female mentorship and role model programs

> *"... the influence of role models is strong among women who don't study computing at college but then go on to pursue a computing career."*

I was trying to think of a metafor for Psychology, and I keep coming back to the story of the pied piper. Probably because of the megadeth song.

I feel as though psychology lures in innocent sweet children with its sweet and harmonious symphony only to lure them to the mountain of data science from which some will never return

## Why might more women than men choose psychology?^[Su et al. (2009). *Psychological Bulletin*, 135(6), 859–884. [doi.org/10.1037/a0017364](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0017364)]

Do women have strong interest in problem-solving, especially around real-world and social issues?

Su et al. (2009) massive meta-analysis looking at differences in interests in men and women. Let's focus on the RIASEC model of vocational interests.

Technical manuals for 47 interest inventories were used, yielding 503,188 respondents.

Men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people, producing a large effect size (d = 0.93) on the Things–People dimension.
On the Data-Ideas dimension there was a small effect towards women favouring ideas over data (d = -0.1)

Men showed stronger Realistic (d = 0.84) and Investigative (d = 0.26) interests
Women showed stronger Artistic (d = -0.35), Social (d = -0.68), and Conventional (d = -0.33) interests.

Age effects: as age increases the sex differences on Things-People decrease as do differences on social interests.

Diagram shows the main areas of model. Larger circles show larger pooled effect sizes representing male-female differences. The key finding is women are more interested in people, and men in things.


RIASEC model of vocational interests
Realistic - interest in working with things and gadgets or working outdoors;
Investigative interest in science, including mathematics, physical and social sciences, and biological and medical sciences;
Artistic interest in creative expression, including writing and the visual and performing arts;
Social interest in helping people;
Enterprising interest in working in leadership or persuasive roles directed toward achieving economic objectives; and
Conventional interest in working in well-structured environments, especially
business settings.

## Psychology and coding

> *"... applying computing and coding to real societal problems can help change the world, which can be a powerful hook for girls and a magnet for women."*


- The skills acquired through learning `r rproj()` will be taught within the context of Psychology examples.
- Psychology is a science that looks to addresses societal and inter- and intra-personal problems.

:::{.notes}

I need a more positive metaphor, so I'm going for a cloak of invisibiloity. Who doesn't like one of those?

So, for some students, their interests and career desires lay hidden under a cloak of invisibility. they think they want a career in psychology but only because data science is hidden to them as an option. Mentors remove the invisibility cloak revealing options and confidence they never thought they had!

Our undergraduates do not meet a make faculty member teaching stats/computing until autumn term of year 2 (where they meet me)

Across their core methods modules, they are taught by 2 male faculty compared to 7 females (this is roughly in line with the ratio of 80% female intake).

This may also help to challenge some of the stereotypes in male students

Today... out of 5 finalist graduates... they chose me to be their new data analyst!!! I spoke to the CEO over the phone, and he commented that he couldn't believe I had been coding for only a couple of years, and that my work was far more advanced than any other graduate he has had - and that's because of you!!

As a lazy student, I didn't even read my prospectus before joining, so it was a complete (unpleasant) surprise that I was studying statistics and coding. During secondary school, I barely scraped a C in Higher Maths GCSE. As such, I was absolutely terrified to learn that I now had to learn coding and statistics ...

What can you do within your company?

Being mindful of not adding disproportionately to the workload of women

- Recognise and celebrate women's achievements/roles as much as mens
- Make sure people in junior roles are aware of women in senior roles
- Look outside of your company for activities and opportunities that support women

:::


## Too long, didn't listen

Ask yourself these questions

- Are there women in non-coding roles who I could support to try coding?
- Do our training materials motivate and engage women?
- Who are the role models inside and outside of my group?
- Am I doing enough to challenge stereotypes around coding?
- Can we do more outreach (STEM ambassadors)?
