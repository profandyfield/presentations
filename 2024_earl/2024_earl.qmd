In STEM, retention is at about 0.7 (30% dropout) after 3 years, and close to 50% dropout over 10 years

## Cracking the gender code: recommendations

### Junior high (10-14 years)

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 1**: Deepen girls' hands-on computing experience
  + More exposure to games = more likely to go into coding (But ...)
  + Introduce coding through computer games

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 2**: Change girls' perceptions of computing
  - Challenge stereotypes
  - Role models

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 3**: Support parents in understanding the wider role of computing

:::

::: {.fragment}
> "... there is little awareness among any group that applying computing and coding to real societal problems can help change the world, which can be a powerful hook for girls and a magnet for women."
:::


##

### High school (14-18 years)

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 1**: Redesign computing courses to appeal to girls

> "81% of high school girls who studied computing over the summer were interested in studying computing at college, compared to 52% of those who only studied computing at school."

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 2**: Create grassroots campaigns to motivate peer group action

> "Definitely [girls want] more clubs and after schools programs. We should be making a connection between ladies of distinction and computing or coding, because a lot of the girls want to feel empowered." (Teacher)

:::

## 

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 3**: Attract more women teachers

> "62% of girls in high school who have had someone encourage them to study computing and coding say they are likely to major in it at college, compared to only 15% who have had no role model."

![](media/ms_confident.png){fig-align="center" width=500 }

:::

##

### College (18+ years)

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 1**: Give computing courses a makeover

> "This includes engaging young women by describing computing courses – and
potential careers in the field – in ways that capture women's strong interest in
problem-solving, especially around real-world and social issues."

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 2**: Offer female students immersion programs
  + Essentially, allow exposure to coding on non-coding courses and make it easy to switch.

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Action 3**: Create female mentorship and role model programs

> "... the influence of role models is strong among women who don't study computing at college but then go on to pursue a computing career."

## Recurring themes

Do women have strong interest in problem-solving, especially around real-world and social issues?

Su et al. (2009) massive meta-analysis looking at differences in interests in men and women. Let's focus on the RIASEC model of vocational interests.

Diagram shows the main areas of model. Larger circles show larger pooled effect sizes representing male-female differences. The key finding is women are more interested in people, and men in things.


RIASEC model of vocational interests
Realistic - interest in working with things and gadgets or working outdoors;
Investigative interest in science, including mathematics, physical and social sciences, and biological and medical sciences;
Artistic interest in creative expression, including writing and the visual and performing arts;
Social interest in helping people;
Enterprising interest in working in leadership or persuasive roles directed toward achieving economic objectives; and
Conventional interest in working in well-structured environments, especially
business settings.

- The skills acquired through learning `r rproj()` will be taught within the context of Psychology examples.
- Psychology is a science that looks to addresses societal and inter- and intra-personal problems.

# Too long, didn't listen

- Important ways to encourage women into computing
  - Contexts that are engaging for women
  - Role models
  
- Psychology
  - Predominantly female intake
  - Large numbers of female faculty (role models)
  - Involves topics/themes that naturally interest women
  - Involves a lot of statistics and statistical computing
  - At some institutions statistical computing involves software (`r rproj()`) that requires coding and computing skills.
  - The `r rproj()` ecosystem is diverse, inclusive and full of brilliant rolw models
