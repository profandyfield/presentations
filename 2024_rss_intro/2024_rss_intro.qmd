##  The student experience^[Guest & Forbes (2023). Teaching coding inclusively: if this, then what? [doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3r2ez](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3r2ez)]

> Students want or need graphical user interfaces (GUIs), otherwise they do not enjoy the course and/or they cannot learn as well.

::: fragment

> We cannot teach them to code because scoping (or any other programming concept) is difficult and time-consuming to learn.

> Teaching students to code is zero-sum, so that means removing other parts of the course.

> You cannot teach them how to code during a stats class because some students will have a "handicap" if they have not coded before.

Guest & Forbes (2023) identify several pervasive and unhelpful dialogues around learning programming

I've picked out 4 of the dialogues identifies by Guest and Forbes that are particularly relevant to this talk

We certainly experienced all of these (or close variants) when we converted our syllabus from SPSS to R.

The 'they won't be able to cope' narrative was particularly strong.

I tend to think that with the correct support and scaffolding students will meet the expectations you set them.

- Assessment
  - Capture students' abilities
  - Efficient to implement and mark
